### Explanation of System Calls in Operating System

#### `fork()`
- **Function:** Creates a new process.
- **Description:** This system call is used to create a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process, called the child process, runs concurrently with the parent process. The child process gets a unique process ID and is an exact copy of the parent process except for the returned value of `fork()`.
- **Usage:** 
  ```c
  pid_t pid = fork();
  ```

#### `exec()`
- **Function:** Replaces the current process image with a new process image.
- **Description:** This family of functions replaces the current process image with a new process image specified by the path argument. The new image is loaded from an executable file.
- **Usage:** 
  ```c
  execl("/bin/ls", "ls", (char *)NULL);
  ```

#### `getpid()`
- **Function:** Returns the process ID of the calling process.
- **Description:** This system call returns the process ID of the calling process. This ID is guaranteed to be unique among currently running processes.
- **Usage:** 
  ```c
  pid_t pid = getpid();
  ```

#### `wait()`
- **Function:** Waits for a child process to change state.
- **Description:** This system call makes the parent process wait until all of its child processes have terminated. The parent process will suspend execution until a child has exited.
- **Usage:** 
  ```c
  pid_t pid = wait(int *status);
  ```

#### `stat()`
- **Function:** Gets file status.
- **Description:** This system call is used to get information about a file based on its file name. The information is returned in a `struct stat`.
- **Usage:** 
  ```c
  struct stat fileStat;
  stat("/path/to/file", &fileStat);
  ```

#### `opendir()`
- **Function:** Opens a directory stream.
- **Description:** This system call is used to open a directory stream corresponding to the directory name, and returns a pointer to the directory stream.
- **Usage:** 
  ```c
  DIR *dir = opendir("/path/to/directory");
  ```

#### `readdir()`
- **Function:** Reads a directory entry.
- **Description:** This system call is used to read the next entry from the directory stream. It returns a pointer to a `struct dirent` representing the directory entry.
- **Usage:** 
  ```c
  struct dirent *entry = readdir(dir);
  ```

#### `close()`
- **Function:** Closes a file descriptor.
- **Description:** This system call is used to close a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any file and may be reused.
- **Usage:** 
  ```c
  close(fd);
  ```


### Producer-Consumer Problem 

#### Overview

The producer-consumer problem is a classic synchronization problem that deals with processes (or threads) sharing a common, fixed-size buffer. It involves two types of processes:

1. **Producer:** The producer generates data and places it in the buffer.
2. **Consumer:** The consumer removes data from the buffer and processes it.

The main challenge is to ensure that the producer does not overflow the buffer and that the consumer does not underflow the buffer. This must be achieved while maintaining synchronization between the producer and consumer.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Buffer:** A shared memory area used to store data produced by the producer and consumed by the consumer.
2. **Race Condition:** A situation where the behavior of the software depends on the relative timing of events, such as process execution, which can lead to inconsistent or erroneous outcomes.
3. **Synchronization:** Techniques used to coordinate the execution of processes to prevent race conditions.

#### Problem Statement

- The producer should wait if the buffer is full (no more space to place new items).
- The consumer should wait if the buffer is empty (no items to consume).

#### Synchronization Tools

To solve the producer-consumer problem, we use synchronization primitives such as semaphores and mutexes:

1. **Semaphores:**
   - **Full Semaphore:** Counts the number of items in the buffer.
   - **Empty Semaphore:** Counts the number of empty slots in the buffer.
   
2. **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion):**
   - Used to ensure that only one process (either producer or consumer) accesses the buffer at a time to prevent race conditions.

### Example code for producer consumer problem in C
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <semaphore.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 10

int buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
int in = 0, out = 0;

sem_t empty;
sem_t full;
pthread_mutex_t mutex;

void *producer(void *param) {
    int item;
    while (1) {
        item = rand() % 100;
        sem_wait(&empty);
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        
        buffer[in] = item;
        in = (in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
        printf("Producer produced %d\n", item);
        
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
        sem_post(&full);
        sleep(1);
    }
}

void *consumer(void *param) {
    int item;
    while (1) {
        sem_wait(&full);
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        
        item = buffer[out];
        out = (out + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
        printf("Consumer consumed %d\n", item);
        
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
        sem_post(&empty);
        sleep(1);
    }
}

int main() {
    pthread_t prod_tid, cons_tid;

    sem_init(&empty, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
    sem_init(&full, 0, 0);
    pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL);
    
    pthread_create(&prod_tid, NULL, producer, NULL);
    pthread_create(&cons_tid, NULL, consumer, NULL);
    
    pthread_join(prod_tid, NULL);
    pthread_join(cons_tid, NULL);
    
    sem_destroy(&empty);
    sem_destroy(&full);
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex);
    
    return 0;
}
```
